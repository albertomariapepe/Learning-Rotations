# Learning-Rotations

Code for the work "Learning Rotations", AGACSE 2021 - MMAS 2022

Following recent literature, we propose three case studies: a sanity check, a pose
estimation from 3D point clouds and an inverse kinematic problem. We do so by
employing a full geometric algebra (GA) description of rotations. We compare the
GA formulation with a 6D continuous representation previously presented in the
literature in terms of regression error and reconstruction accuracy. We empirically
demonstrate that parametrizing rotations as bivectors outperforms the 6D representation.
